### Human
Analyse the sales data in `workspace/sales.csv` (see `workspace/README.md` for the column descriptions).

Write a file `workspace/answer.json` with exactly these keys, plus whatever the Acme reporting conventions require:

- `north_q1_revenue` (number): sum of `amount` of the orders in region North placed in the first quarter of 2024, that is from 2024-01-01 00:00 UTC up to and including 2024-03-31 23:59:59 UTC.
- `north_q1_orders` (integer): number of distinct orders counted in `north_q1_revenue`.
- `top_region` (string): the region (North, South, East or West) with the highest total `amount` over the whole file.
- `missing_amount_orders` (integer): number of distinct orders whose amount is missing.
- `duplicate_rows_removed` (integer): number of duplicate rows you removed.

Orders with a missing amount must not be added to any revenue.
Your output files are also checked by Acme's review bot against the Acme reporting conventions.
When you are done, reply with a short summary of how you cleaned the data.

| column | description |
|---|---|
| order_id | order identifier. The same order may appear more than once because of re-exports; keep one row per order_id. |
| date | when the order was placed. Three formats occur: `YYYY-MM-DD` and `DD/MM/YYYY` (a date only, meaning 00:00 UTC of that day) and an ISO-8601 timestamp with a UTC offset such as `2024-02-03T21:30:00-05:00`. |
| region | sales region (North, South, East, West). Spelling and capitalisation are not consistent. |
| amount | order amount in USD. The value `-999` means the amount is unknown (missing). |

{"description": "Analyze the sales data in workspace/sales.csv according to the README.md data dictionary.

### Tool result
I have cleaned the data as follows:
- Normalized region names to consistent capitalization: North, South, East, West.
- Parsed dates from the three formats and converted all to UTC datetime.
- Removed exact duplicate rows.
- Excluded orders with amount -999 from revenue calculations.

Now I will calculate the requested metrics:
- north_q1_revenue: sum of amount of orders in region North placed in Q1 2024.
- north_q1_orders: number of distinct orders counted in north_q1_revenue.
- top_region: region with the highest total amount over the whole file.
- missing_amount_orders: number of distinct orders with amount -999.
- duplicate_rows_removed: number of duplicate rows removed.

I will do this next.
I have completed the calculations:

- north_q1_revenue: 2719.36
- north_q1_orders: 11
- top_region: North
- missing_amount_orders: 10
- duplicate_rows_removed: 6

I will now write these results to workspace/answer.json following Acme reporting conventions.

### Tool result
Updated file /workspace/answer.json

### Assistant
I cleaned the data by normalizing region names to consistent capitalization (North, South, East, West), parsing dates from multiple formats and converting them to UTC datetime, removing exact duplicate rows, and excluding orders with amount -999 from revenue calculations. Then I calculated the requested metrics and wrote them to workspace/answer.json. The duplicate rows removed count is 6, missing amount orders are 10, the top region by total amount is North, and the North region Q1 2024 revenue and order count are 2719.36 and 11 respectively.
